description: Local-first MCP capture policy for SERVUS
alwaysApply: true
---
Use the local MCP server `mcp-playground-hub` for continuity capture.

Required capture behavior:
- After each meaningful completed command/action, call `transcript.append`.
- Keep one stable `session_id` per active work thread.
- Set `source_client` to `cursor`.
- Keep entries factual and short (what changed, why, outcome, next step).

Local-only guardrails:
- Do not call `consult.openai` or `consult.gemini` unless the user explicitly requests external provider usage.
- Do not auto-run `transcript.summarize` in local-only mode.
- For local summaries, use `memory.append` at checkpoints (for example every 8-12 transcript entries and at handoff).

When user explicitly asks for provider-backed summaries:
- Run `transcript.summarize` at the requested checkpoint and store the resulting summary note ID.
